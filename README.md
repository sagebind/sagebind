Hello there! I'm a full-time software engineer that is passionate about web and system software, efficiency, and open-source. I work on open-source projects in my spare time. Currently working on Rust-related projects.

Please note that due to life circumstances, my free time for open-source projects is currently more limited than in the past until further notice.
